TODO:

* make injections to oneliners , example:
  for x in range(3): print(x); print("next")
  --should probably become-->
  _tp(0)
  for x in range(3): _tp(0); print(x); print("next")

* implement watches and breakpoints :)

* maybe somehow catch returning from functions
  to see better, which value is returned (as in PythonTutor)
